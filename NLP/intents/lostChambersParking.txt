Do you provide parking for the lost chambers aquarium
<-answer->
Guests can park at The Avenues. Parking is subject to availability and a minimum spend of AED150 is required for the guests to be able to valet park. We have another option for parking which is available at Nasimi beach car park â€“ when driving up The Palm towards Atlantis, please take a first right at the roundabout before the guests reach the Atlantis, The Palm building. A shuttle bus will pick them up from the branded bus hop-on/ hop-off area and drop them off at the Avenues entrance from where they will reach the Aquaventure Ticketing Plaza and they can head towards the Lost Chambers.
