Can I pay extra for an aquaventure Fast Track Pass or aquaventure VIP Access
<-answer->
For VIP experience we recommend you to visit the VIP Premier Experiences counter at the Aquaventure Ticketing Plaza. The guests are able to book Waterpark Cabanas or book their exclusive reserved seating at Neptune’s Retreat as well as receive admission tickets to Aquaventure Waterpark.  We also offer a Fast Track Pass which will allow guests immediate access to the water slides and rides. It’s at a cost of AED200 per person (additional to the admission rate) and only 300 tickets are sold daily.
