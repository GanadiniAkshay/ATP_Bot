Can I still use the hotel facilities once I've checked out
<-answer->
Yes, there are many facilities that can be used by our guests on the same day after their check out. All guests are welcome to access Aquaventure & Lost Chambers after 12:00hrs. A pass is given at the Front Office at the time of checkout.We also have the changing and shower facilities at the Aquaventure Waterpark from 10.00hrs - Sunset. Guests with Imperial Club room may use the shower and changing facilities in the Imperial Club West Tower Lounge after their check out on the same day.
