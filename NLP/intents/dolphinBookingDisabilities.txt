Do you recommend/make dolphin bookings for guests with disabilities?
<-answer->
Yes, Dolphin Bay is open for everyone as long as the guest with disability is able to take part in the interaction. If the person needs an assistant this will be counted as another paying participant and must be disclosed at the time of booking an interaction.
