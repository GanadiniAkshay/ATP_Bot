Cameras, Jewelries, Hair accessories or any loose article are not allowed in the water for the safety of our Dolphins. The guests have an opportunity to purchase the photos taken by our professional photographer or if there is an Observer the camera can be left with the observer who can take photos from the private beach of Dolphin Bay.
