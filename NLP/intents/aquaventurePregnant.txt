Am I allowed to visit the aquaventure waterpark if I'm pregnant

Pregnant women are allowed into the park, however many of the slides are not recommended for pregnant women. Aquaventure does offer multiple lagoons and beaches to relax by as an alternative. All guests can participate in all attractions at their own risk.
