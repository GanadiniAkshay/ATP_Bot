Is the Parent or personal Nanny allowed to accompany the Children in Kids Club?
<-answer->
Kids Club is an adult-free zone, due to our strict child safety and security policy parents/personal nannies will not be permitted in the facility. However, if you require one to one supervision during Kids Club activities, you can book Atlantis Babysitter to accompany child inside Kids Club (terms and conditions applies)
