How do I check out
<-answer->
Guests may either settle their bill a night before they check out or go directly to the Front Office at 12.00hrs to do the formalities. We also have an option of Express Check out which can be found in Atlantean booklet kept in all rooms. The guests are required to sign the form and pass by the reception to drop it at the express counter for Express Checkout.
