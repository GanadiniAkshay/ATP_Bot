My child is a mature 2 year old/ almost 3 years old; can he still attend Kids Club?
<-answer->
We have a strict age policy in place which is designed to maximize the fun and safety of all children in our care.Children less than 3 years old are more than welcome to experience the Kids Club; however they would need to be with one of our babysitters (babysitting fees and Kids Club admission fees apply).
